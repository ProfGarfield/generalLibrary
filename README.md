generalLibrary.lua provides the code necessary to run these functions.

You can use it by including the following line in your events.lua file (or other module)

local gen = require("generalLibrary")

PolygonScript.lua is a script to help use the function gen.inPolygon.  It is not necessary to include it in the release of your scenario.
